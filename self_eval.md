# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

Up to now, pretty good. I know how they function and work but sometimes understanding what the actual method means from the ruby docs can be confusing. I usually have to run the own exercises myself before I can understand it.  

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Relatively confident, as long as they're not too complex! But I'm sure with time that will become easier. It's easy when I think about how the "def" and "end" create a limited universe in which the work is done. 

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

I guess my main question is about whether there are resources that explain what the methods to without such complex language and discourse? Or if coming to understand the Ruby guides just comes with practice as I become a better coder.
